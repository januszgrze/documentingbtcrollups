# Documenting Bitcoin Rollups

Hey there! My name is Ian and I'm a digital cash enthusiast. I recently worked on a privacy-enabled layer 1, and am now taking a break from full-time work to travel and learn about things I find interesting.

I've found the potential for validity rollups on Bitcoin pretty interesting, and since there's more discussion on them at the moment, I thought I'd document it in this repository as an educational resource for myself and potentially others.

In this repo, I'll document:

- Podcast and Twitter spaces episodes and notes
- Aggregate threads and social media content
- Aggregate and highlight research

As I do this, I'll likely start drafting newsletters. These newsletters will be more digestable than the notes I take and can likely be presented to interested audiences.

I have experience with writing content on ZKPs and such, but feel this area is a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm really excited to push myself and learn :)

Thanks for checking this out!

PS. If you ever see anything glaryingly wrong in this repo, please let me know so I can edit.
